During my studies at Centrale, I chose the elective course of Time Series and Agent-based Models in Finance which I validated with the grade of 20/20. You will find in each file the subjects treated in practical works, approaching the various concepts seen in course such as Bonferroni Cointegration, GARCH & ARIMA, and heavy tail. In each file my code and a correction.
